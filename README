Big F'n Rocket

The most ridiculous game we can think of.
It'll consume all your nights & weekends, just like working at SpaceX.
Be a part of mankind's greatest adventure.
It makes a Saturn V look like a toy.

track notes:
    side arrows define track
    track is sideways
    player controls altitude 
    2 dimensions
    blender curve for each side & scripts to generate model
    ramps






Obsolete Freecad notes:

Paste engines from raptor.fcstd into bfs.fcstd, 2 sea levels & 4 vacuums.
Place BFS engines by running bfs_engines.FCMacro 


Synthesize a grid fin by running grid.FCMacro
Copy parts from grid_parts.fcstd into the grid.
Tesselate by running export_grid.FCMacro
Paste grids into booster.fcstd
Place grids using place_grids.FCMacro



Create sea level raptor mesh in raptor.fcstd with export_raptor.FCMacro
Paste 31 sea level engines from raptor.fcstd into booster.fcstd
Place booster engines by running booster_engines.FCMacro 




launchpad.blend - the launchpad
Export by selecting ground, launchpad, tower
GLTF options: apply modifiers, selected only
